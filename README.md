 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard | Data Analytics Project 📊
I recently worked on a Road Accident Data Analysis project, where I performed end-to-end data analytics and designed an interactive dashboard to derive meaningful insights from accident data.

🔍 What I did in this project:
✔️ Data Cleaning:
Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and standardized formats
Ensured data accuracy for reliable analysis

✔️ Data Transformation:
Created calculated fields and measures
Segmented data by severity, vehicle type, road type, surface condition, light condition, and weather

✔️ KPI Analysis:
Total casualties & severity-wise breakdown (Fatal, Serious, Slight)
Casualties by vehicle type, road type, and road surface
Current Year vs Previous Year (YoY) monthly trend analysis
Urban vs Rural and Daylight vs Darkness Impact Analysis

📈 Key Insights from the Dashboard:
The majority of casualties fall under Slight Severity
Cars contribute the highest number of casualties
Single carriageways record the maximum accidents
Most accidents occur on dry road surfaces and during daylight
Clear trend comparison between current and previous year accident patterns

🛠️ Skills & Tools Applied:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
KPI Definition & Business Understanding
Data Transformation & Analysis
Dashboard Design & Data Visualization
Analytical storytelling for decision-making
This project strengthened my ability to think like a Data Analyst, convert raw data into insights, and present them through a clear, decision-focused dashboard.
